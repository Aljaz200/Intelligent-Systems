## Seminar Projects:

### Seminar 1: Optimizing Conference Paper Assignment Using Genetic Algorithms

**Objective**:\
The goal of this seminar was to design a system to optimize the assignment of conference papers to reviewers using genetic algorithms. The solution had to maximize overall satisfaction by aligning reviewer preferences while meeting specific constraints.

**Key Tasks**:

- **Representation**: Develop a data structure and representation for reviewer-paper assignments, considering preferences, friendship constraints, and authorship restrictions.
- **Crossover and Mutation**: Customize genetic algorithm operations to ensure constraint satisfaction and generate valid solutions.
- **Diversity and Complexity**: Introduce mechanisms to explore diverse and complex solutions, penalizing constraint violations.
- **Evaluation**: Conduct experiments to compare the performance of different configurations and provide a detailed analysis of results.

### Seminar 2: Text Classification for Emotion Detection

**Objective**:\
The aim of this seminar was to train and evaluate an NLP classification model capable of detecting six emotions (sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise) in text.

**Key Tasks**:

- **Data Preparation and Exploration**: Process the dataset, handle missing values, analyze class distributions, and prepare data for machine learning.
- **Basic Machine Learning**: Train and evaluate standard ML models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Experiment with advanced NLP techniques, including neural networks, pre-trained embeddings, fine-tuning, and ensemble models. Extend the dataset by incorporating additional data and analyze its impact.
- **Evaluation and Reporting**: Compare the performance of various models and configurations using clear visualizations and analysis.
